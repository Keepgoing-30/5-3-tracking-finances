**You will use the tracking_finances.py file to write your code.**

Your finance tracker will present a menu to the user and allow that user to choose from a menu of options:

1. **Calculate Net Pay and Report Withholding Amounts**
    - When calculating net pay and reporting withholding, ask the user for wage and time worked.
    - To determine withholding, calculate and report federal tax, local tax, and Social Security using the simplified percentages shown in the section above.

2. **Track Monthly Costs and Income**
    - In tracking income and expenses, the user can enter as many transactions as desired, as long as he/she answer 'Y' to the prompt "Another? (Y/N)".

3. **Report Monthly Discretionary Spending (i.e., Non-Committed Funds) Amount Available**
    - In determining monthly discretionary spending, the value is calculated based upon totals from item 2 above: tracking income and expenses.
